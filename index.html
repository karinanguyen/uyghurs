                    Does Chinese influence and diplomatic relations in countries around the globe affect media reports 
                    and mentions on a controversial Uyghurs’ issue? We will explore number of "Uyghurs" mentions in media reports from 2017-2021 
                    from different countries. Silence on Uyghurs issue from media might tell us a lot, especially if we see such pattern from certain countries and look at their diplomatic relations with China.

                    In April 2021, Joe Biden’s US administration has officially accused China of committing “genocide” against the Uyghur ethnic minority in the Xinjiang region.

                    Since we don't have the sentiment of those mentions, this insight makes total sense. We can see more than 100 mentions from democracies and well-developed countries like UK, Belgium, France.  
                    Interestingly Taiwan, Hong Kong, Iran, Iraq, Russia is also on this chart, considering China's special relations with those countries. <br><br>

              Here, we have clustered the majors based on the broader category, of which there are 16 in total. The size 
              of the bubbles represent the median salary of graduates from the major. 

              When sorted like this, it's quite clear that engineering majors of all kinds have generally above-average median salaries. <br><br>
              On the other end, it appears that majors in the field of psychology on average have the lowest graduate salaries. <br>

              Bear in mind that some of these figures may suffer from small sample sizes. If you hover over a bubble, you can see additional information,
              including the number of students enrolled in a given major. Salary figures from degrees with lower 
              enrolment may be less accurate due to the smaller pool of student respondents

                  If we rearrange all the data points into a histogram format, the salary potential of engineering majors becomes
              even more stark, as almost all the points on the right of the graph are colored yellow, for engineering. As for all the 
              other majors, they follow a fairly diverse yet tightly spaced distribution, with the modal class being
              salaries between $34,000 and $36,000.

              <h2>Does Gender Influence Chosen Majors?</h2>
              Now what if we took those same categories, but coloured them based on the proportion of the students which are male or female? 
              In this chart, blue represents majors with > 60% male, and red represents > 60% female, and the grey bubbles represent the more gender 
              balanced courses.
              <br><br>(Hover over the labels if you've forgotten the category)<br><br>

              What is striking about this graphic is that almost every category grouping of majors are either decidedly more female-weighted or male-weighted,
              with the exception of perhaps the business and physical sciences majors.

              When we plot the % of students in a major being female against the median salary of students in the major, a fairly clear trend emerges. 
              It appears that majors with a higher proportion of male students also produce students with higher median wages. <br><br> In fact, a linear model
              would predict that for every added percentage of female students in a given major, the median annual salary drops by $306 USD.

              So we've seen the most 'profitable' majors, as well as the ones with the most uneven gender distributions. But what are students 
              actually enrolling in the most frequently? What can enrolment numbers tell us about actual interest in each major? This chart has the bubbles 
              sized based on the number of students enrolled in each major, and coloured by category. 
              <svg id = 'legend3' width = '400px' height = '350px'></svg>
              Psychology is the clear leader in this regard, with over 390,000 students enrolled. Business related topics such as general business, business management,
              accounting and finance are all also heavily enrolled.
